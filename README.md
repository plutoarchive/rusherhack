**stage 1: faq**  

Q: Why?  
A: Just for practice in reverse-engineering and cracking stuff.

Q: How long you've been cracking this?  
A: Like for a week? Not really long tho.

Q: Is RusherMod worth it?  
A: Short answer: It depends. Longer answer: Test it yourself.

**stage 2: are there any issues?**  
  
Yes, sadly.

1.  BowAimbot trajectory prediction is kinda broken, so you need to enable SilentAim, but who the fuck cares?
2.  Client crashes when FoamFix (tranny optimization mod) is installed.
3.  ^ this means there can be other mods that conflict with this client.

1.  Download rushercrack.jar from  [here](https://crystalpvp.ru/rusherhack/rushercrack.jar)
